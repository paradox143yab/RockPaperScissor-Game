## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
Game Description

## My process
During the development of this game, I followed the following process:
  -Planning: I started by understanding the game rules and requirements.   
  -HTML Structure: I created the HTML structure for the game
  -CSS Styling: I applied CSS styles to make the game visually appealing. I used CSS selectors, properties, and values to customize the layout, colors, and animations.
  -JavaScript Logic: I implemented the game logic using JavaScript. I created functions to generate the computer's random choice, compare it with the player's choice, and determine the winner. I also added event listeners to the buttons to capture the player's selection.
  -Testing and Refinement: I thoroughly tested the game for different scenarios, including various player and computer choices.
  -Documentation: I documented the code using this README file to provide instructions, game description, and an overview of my development process.

### Built with

  -HTML: Used for structuring the web page
  -CSS: Used for styling the game elements
  -JavaScript: Used for implementing the game logic and interactivity

### What I learned
During the development of this Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I learned several key concepts and skills, including:

Game logic implementation: I gained experience in translating the rules of a game into code 
DOM manipulation: I learned how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript 
Event handling: I practiced adding event listeners to elements and capturing user interactions to trigger specific actions or functions.
Debugging and testing: I acquired knowledge in debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues in the code. 
Documentation and README creation: I developed skills in documenting my code using clear comments and creating a README file to provide instructions and an overview of the project.
