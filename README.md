## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
Game Description

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously chooses one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
Features

  -player vs. Computer gameplay
  - Interactive buttons for player's choice
  - Random computer choice generation
  - Score tracking and display
  - Outcome display for each round

## My process
During the development of this game, I followed the following process:
Planning: I started by understanding the game rules and requirements. I outlined the basic functionality and identified the necessary HTML elements, CSS styles, and JavaScript functions. 
-HTML Structure: I created the HTML structure for the game, including the header, game area, and result display section. I used semantic HTML tags to ensure accessibility and proper document structure.
-CSS Styling: I applied CSS styles to make the game visually appealing. I used CSS selectors, properties, and values to customize the layout, colors, and animations.
-JavaScript Logic: I implemented the game logic using JavaScript. I created functions to generate the computer's random choice, compare it with the player's choice, and determine the winner. I also added event listeners to the buttons to capture the player's selection.
-Testing and Refinement: I thoroughly tested the game for different scenarios, including various player and computer choices. I debugged any issues and refined the code to ensure smooth gameplay and accurate results.
-Documentation: I documented the code using clear comments and wrote this README file to provide instructions, game description, and an overview of my development process.

### Built with


  -HTML: Used for structuring the web page
  -CSS: Used for styling the game elements
  -JavaScript: Used for implementing the game logic and interactivity

### What I learned
During the development of this Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I learned several key concepts and skills, including:

Game logic implementation: I gained experience in translating the rules of a game into code and developing the necessary functions to determine the outcome based on player choices.
    DOM manipulation: I learned how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to update the game elements dynamically and provide a responsive user interface.
    Event handling: I practiced adding event listeners to elements and capturing user interactions to trigger specific actions or functions.
    Debugging and testing: I acquired knowledge in debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues in the code. I also learned the importance of comprehensive testing to ensure the game functions correctly in different scenarios.
    Documentation and README creation: I developed skills in documenting my code using clear comments and creating a README file to provide instructions and an overview of the project.
